// Pages
// The primary focus today is the product page (products). However, you should slot in a simple home page (index.html), which should have a link to the product page.

// You should also have common/main.css used by all pages, as well as a page-specific css page (like products/products.css).

// Product Page
// The goal for today is to generate a list of products from product data.
